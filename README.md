# Machine Learning Recipes - Fundamentals of ML

My playground using the Scikit-Learn machine learning library for Python, following Google's *Machine Learning Recipes* by Josh Gordon. I desired to develop a fundamental understanding of machine learning and how it implements into source code to solve problems. I then used the knowledge I gained to learn about how Unity enables developers to utilize ML in 3D game design. I hoped to implement their tools into a game of my own, however I was unsuccessful.
